# Phishing Analysis Reports
This is a phishing analysis task with real world sample.

All URLs have been defanged to prevent them from being clickable since most of these links are malicious.
You can fang the URLs with CyberChef ("gchq.github.io/CyberChef")

I will be adding more samples from time to time.
